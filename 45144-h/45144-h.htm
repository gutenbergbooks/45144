<p class="reptitle">KILLARNEY</p>




<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE GLAMOUR OF KILLARNEY</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Killarney</span>&mdash;in Irish &ldquo;the Church of the Sloes&rdquo;&mdash;though
but a small town, is, owing to its position,
the centre from which the wondrously lovely
scenery of the district may best be explored, a
district which has been described as &ldquo;the Mecca
of every pilgrim in search of the sublime and
beautiful in Nature&mdash;the mountain paradise of the
West.&rdquo; Yet if the magical softness of shimmering
wave and wooded isle, the glory of their
colouring, the ineffable peace which broods over
hill and vale, tempt the summer visitor to think
that Paradise could not be fairer, there are dark
glens, frowning mountains, and sombre passes,
which but too vividly remind the beholder that
on earth must the shadow always follow the sunshine,
the minor note of sadness be heard, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
even in this enchanted spot has the war-cry
many a time been sounded, and men have
wreaked their fierce passions and poured out their
blood, and women, stricken to the heart, have
suffered and died under these tender skies. The
ruined castles tell their own story.</p>

<p>To analyze the charm of Killarney Vale is
impossible. It is the very region of romance,
and one to which fairy legend and ghostly tale
seem to fit themselves better than do the commonplaces
of life. There would seem nothing strange
were the O&rsquo;Donoghue on his white charger seen
to cleave the wave and emerge on its foam-flecked
shore, coming we know not whence,
going we know not where, but real as when he
trod his native glens, a prince and a ruler among
men. The unseen world seems very near to
those who have fallen under the spell of fair
Killarney.</p>

<p>Part of this charm is doubtless due to the
wonder of its beauty, the ceaseless contrasts it
presents. I have seen a theory advanced of late
years that, as is the land, so are the dwellers
thereon; that the character of the soil determines
that of its children; the rivers which they look
upon, rapid and lawless, or strong and silent; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
dark forest; the rich fields or the barren plains;
the mysterious mountain or the gay valley, alike
influence&mdash;nay, form&mdash;their individuality. There
is a remarkable passage in the autobiography of
a very remarkable man&mdash;Stillman (war correspondent
to the <i>Times</i> in its earlier days), in
which he speaks of the effect which a few weeks&rsquo;
sojourn among the then primeval forests on the
banks of the Hudson produced upon him. Over-wearied
by brain work, he had shut himself away
from sight or sound of civilization, from human
companionship, depending on his gun for food,
the waters of the spring for drink. He describes
how gradually the artificialities of life seemed to
slip from him, and he felt akin with grass and
tree, with the skies above him, the clouds which
swept over their surface, the glories of the sun
by day, the moon and the stars by night. He
seemed also conscious of a world of spirits, or at
least beings not of flesh and blood, very close to
him. Sometimes as he lay at rest upon the
grass a radiant face looked down on him; once
or twice a voice spoke. Above all, he felt confident
he was being guided when external guidance
was impossible, in black darkness, and when a
mistake or false step meant death. He believed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
that senses we have lost revive, and that we grow
cognisant of a world other than that we habitually
live in, as, far away from the haunts of men,
we let Nature speak to us once more.</p>

<p>In many voices has Nature spoken to the
children of Killarney, weaving something of the
changeableness, the melancholy, the deep gloom,
and the overflowing sunshine of their hills and
vales into the very heart of the people, making
them what they are for good or ill. To them
has been given vision of the supernatural region
as a refuge to the earth-bound spirit from the
sordid cares of money-getting; and so has a
world of dreamers, for all their outward gaiety
and lightheartedness, been created in the kingdom
of Kerry. Dreamers we call them, but, after all,
may not Jean Paul Richter&rsquo;s words be prophetic,
and the dreamers yet awaken from life&rsquo;s uneasy
sleep to find its dreams alone were true.</p>

<p class="caption">THE GAP OF DUNLOE ON A STORMY DAY.<br />
The wildness of the Gap is a great contrast to the lake scenery to which it gives access.</p>
</div>

<p>The name of Killarney conjures up such
thoughts. It owes its fame solely to its beauty
and to the fascination which the character of
that beauty exercises over the beholder. For it
is never the same, and every change appeals to
the imagination. Who that has seen it can
forget the superb tinting of the foliage which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
clothes the mountain sides and transforms the
isles into quivering kaleidoscopes of colour,
flashing back the light as the waves of a sunlit
sea. Then a shadow flits from the mountain
tops, and the hues change as though under the
spell of a magician hidden among those far-off
caves, but only to a yet richer combination.
Gorse and heather, arbutus and fern, show a
softer radiance, less dazzling, but more sympathetic;
silvery rills course down the declivities
which surround the lakes, now visible through
the trees and giant shrubs, now hidden, but
always with a murmur of sound like distant notes
of the fairy music which once, it is said, woke
the echoes of Killarney. And for those who
have the hearing ear it may do so still; with
unbelievers the &ldquo;good people&rdquo; have no intercourse.</p>

<p>There is a supernatural origin ascribed to
almost everything in Killarney&mdash;to the lakes
among the rest. These are formed and supplied
by the numerous minor lakes in the surrounding
mountains, and by several rivers which flow into
them, having received on their way the waters
of innumerable tributary streams, all finding an
outlet by the rapid river Laune, which bears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
them to the Atlantic through the beautiful bay
of Dingle.</p>

<p>But in long-ago days there were no lakes at
Killarney&mdash;so legend says&mdash;only an extensive
and inhabited valley, fair and fertile. In this
was a magic fountain, which supplied water clear
as crystal, concerning which a tradition existed
that whoever should displace the stone over the
well-head would bring destruction to himself
and to the valley. It was the reckless daring of
a mortal which caused the fulfilment of this prediction.
One of the great O&rsquo;Donoghues, to
prove the falsity of a tradition which he scorned,
resolved in evil hour to have the stone removed
to his castle. With fear and trembling his
subjects, who dared not disobey him, awaited the
result, all save his favourite jester, who fled to
the summit of a neighbouring mountain. When
morning came the jester looked down into the
valley, and saw nothing but a great expanse of
water. The valley was flooded in a single night,
and its inhabitants drowned. It is believed,
however, that they did not perish, but still exist
under the lakes, enjoying a happier life than the
earth one they left, feasting, music, and dancing
filling the hours.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE ROAD THROUGH THE GAP: ITS
MEMORIES AND ITS RUINS</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> principal lakes of Killarney are three in
number&mdash;the Upper Lake is the smallest, but
often adjudged the most beautiful; it is two miles
and a half in length by half a mile in breadth,
the Middle (Torc or Muckross) Lake is two miles
long by one broad, while Lough Leane (&ldquo;the
Lake of Learning&rdquo;) is five miles and a half long
by two miles and a half in breadth.</p>

<p>These lakes are connected by channels, narrow,
though sufficiently wide to admit of the passing
of a boat, so in a sense they may be considered
as one, yet each lake possesses a character peculiar
to itself and very distinctive.</p>

<p>Killarney is easy of access in these days. In
less than sixteen hours the tourist may reach it
from London, via Holyhead, while Queenstown,
Liverpool and the newer route by Rosslare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
afford facilities for visitors from every land.
And once arrived they find all the comforts and
luxuries of modern civilization in the first class
hotels, which have sprung up to meet the ever
increasing need of accommodation; hotels from
some of which the visitor may view the beauty
of lake and mountain, the lights and shadows,
the glory of their colouring, without going
further afield.</p>

<p>Killarney itself is a small town of which there
is little to record. Adjoining is the Earl of
Kenmare&rsquo;s demesne, with its fine gardens and
splendid golf links; the latter one of the best
inland courses in Ireland. Visitors can use it on
payment of a small green fee.</p>

<p>To proceed by land to the far-famed Gap of
Dunloe, and, traversing it, take the road to the
Upper Lake, is the general plan followed by the
stranger, for this best shows a great and varied
extent of country, with such contrasts of softness
and grandeur&mdash;nay, desolation&mdash;as no other
scenery presents.</p>

<p>In this land the past has graven deep its
records in ruined castle, tower and abbey, each
with its tale. And the first of these after leaving
Killarney, is to be found at Aghadoe (in Irish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
Acadh-da-ca, &ldquo;the field of the two yew trees&rdquo;).
It is about two miles from Killarney, and a slight
detour to the right must be made to visit it.</p>

<p>Aghadoe stands on an eminence commanding
most lovely views of the lakes and mountains.
It was an ancient bishopric, and here is the ruin
of its Cathedral church, which consists of two
chapels of distinct periods of antiquity. They
lie east and west of each other&mdash;that to the east,
probably dating from about 1158, is in the
Pointed style, and dedicated to the Holy Trinity;
the more ancient, in Hiberno-Romanesque style,
appears to have been built some centuries before
the coming of the Normans, and is far richer and
more beautiful. The western end contains a
doorway of recessed arches, covered with particularly
fine mouldings and decorations.</p>

<p>Not far from the western end are the remains
of what must have been a very fine Round tower,
judging from the style of its masonry, now, however,
only about 15 feet in height. Many of its
stones have been taken away and converted into
tombstones for neighbouring churchyards, or
some other need of the mason. The Castle is
another massive circular fragment of about 30
feet in height, sometimes called &ldquo;The Bishop&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
Chair,&rdquo; sometimes &ldquo;The Pulpit,&rdquo; and believed to
have been the residence of the bishops of the
diocese.</p>

<p>Following the road to the north side of the
lake, several fine demesnes are passed, one of
them, Lakeview House, being the residence of
Sir Morgan Ross O&rsquo;Connell, Bart., grand-nephew
of the Liberator. It is a beautiful drive, and
many a tale of the past will enliven the way, as,
crossing Beaufort Bridge over the Laune, you
reach Dunloe Castle at the west end of the lake,
about seven miles from Killarney town.</p>

<p>Dunloe Castle stands on a height from whence
the view is glorious. This Castle is the seat of
the Mahonys, and is very ancient. An old
history of Kerry mentions that its floors are
formed of very fine planks of the yew tree, a
wood which, when well wrought, has a more
beautiful grain and polish than mahogany. Bees
have taken up their residence for centuries in
this old fortress. They are in curious niches and
angles behind the massive walls and under the
floors. They disturb no one and refuse to be
evicted. A bee-keeper tried if he could tempt
them beyond their bounds by laying &ldquo;sections&rdquo;
in a place to which they had access, with a hope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
of securing some of the honey. They took no
notice. Through a cupboard in one of the walls,
you can see far back a host of these little people,
the self-constituted guests of Dunloe Castle, very
busy over their affairs.</p>

<p>There is a fishing lodge close to Dunloe Castle.
This is let during the season, and very fine sport
is to be had. The splendid lake and river fishing
about Killarney is no small attraction to the
angler, both being well stocked with the finest
trout and salmon.</p>

<p>A very remarkable cave near the Gap of
Dunloe was accidentally discovered in 1838, and
was then and subsequently explored with much
interest. Its roof has now fallen in. It was a
subterranean chamber of circular form, the walls
of uncemented stones inclining inwards, with a
roof also of long transverse stones, the angles of
which are covered with Ogham writing, &ldquo;which
is to the Irish antiquary what the Runes are in
the north, the Arrow-headed or Wedge characters
in Babylonia or Persepolis. Arch&aelig;ological discoveries
in Ireland are of more general interest
than formerly, as the earth is laying bare her
secrets all over the world, and what is discovered
in one country is found to have its bearing on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
something brought to light in another.&rdquo; The
discovery of Ogham characters in this cave was
additional evidence that the Irish had a literature
far in advance of the rest of Europe and long
before the Christian era.</p>

<p>Close to the entrance of the Gap stands Kate
Kearney&rsquo;s cottage as, whether it contains a
&ldquo;Kate&rdquo; or not, it will always be called. There
is many a pretty girl in Kerry whose bright eyes,
clear colouring and beautiful hair attract the
passer by, but Kate will be remembered to the
end of time, because of the few lines which,
&ldquo;lilting&rdquo; from a poet&rsquo;s heart, conferred upon her
the crown of immortal youth and beauty:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;From the glance of her eye, shun danger and fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For fatal&rsquo;s the glance of Kate Kearney!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is the fashion to depreciate Moore as a poet,
to compare his lyrics to the notes of a musical-box,
sweet indeed, but devoid of true inspiration.
Yet he fulfilled a noble mission in his day,
rescuing and bringing to light the music of his
country, wedding it to words that tell its story or
reveal its beauties instead of the worthless jingle
which had so often degraded it. It was Moore&rsquo;s
poetry which greatly helped to make Killarney
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
known early in the last century to many in
England.</p>

<p>Readers of the literature of that day will know
what an influence Moore was in its intellectual
circles&mdash;his wit, his geniality, his singing, &ldquo;the
effect of which,&rdquo; writes N.&nbsp;P. Willis, who met
him at Lady Blessington&rsquo;s, &ldquo;is only equalled by
the beauty of his own words.&rdquo; His voice was
of small compass, but exquisitely modulated and
expressing every shade of feeling and sentiment,
so that women have been known to faint as they
listened to his singing, which awakened, perhaps,
a buried sorrow, a long past anguish.</p>

<p>Once enter the Gap of Dunloe and the scene
utterly changes; gone is the soft verdure, the
brilliant tinting, silent the song of birds. On
either side rise huge rocks, of strange, fantastic
shapes, often appearing half suspended over the
path, while never far from it rushes the dark Loe,
&ldquo;a brawling and angry stream,&rdquo; which traverses
the whole length of the Gap, about four miles,
often passing along heights, then tumbling into
depths with rush and roar, now near, now distant,
but ever voicing the wild emotions which seem
to lurk amid the gloom of this stern defile. It
expands into five lakes, called collectively the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
Cummeen Lakes, during its passage through the
Gap.</p>

<p>Tradition ascribes the origin of this wild pass
to a stroke from the sword of a mighty giant,
which separated the mountains and left them
apart for ever, MacGillicuddy&rsquo;s Reeks on one
side, Toomies and the Purple Mountain on the
other. Very stern and grand look the Reeks, one
of their peaks, Carn-tual (&ldquo;the inverted sickle&rdquo;)
rising higher than any mountain in Ireland&mdash;3,414
feet above the level of the sea. There is softer
beauty on the mountains to the left, the Purple
Mountain in particular (2,739 feet in height).
The lovely hue which pervades this mountain is
generally ascribed to a purple heath, which
covers its sides, almost to the top, with perpetual
bloom. Its name, however, was originally derived
from an immense pile of loose stones and
slates of a purple tint, which becomes intense
when the sun shines upon them.</p>

<p>It is from the Gap of Dunloe that the Purple
Mountain should be ascended; it is not a formidable
climb, but ponies await those who fear the
fatigue. The view from the summit is magnificent.</p>

<p>The western base of this mountain descends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
into Augher Lake, and close to this spot is the
Woodwork Factory, where carved specimens of
arbutus and other woods can be obtained in
inlaid tables, chess and backgammon sets, card
cases, etc.</p>

<p>Chess is believed to have been played in prehistoric
times by the ancient Irish, and the
frequent mention of the game long before the
Norman invasion shows it was a favourite one.
&ldquo;The chess board was called in Irish &lsquo;fithcheall,&rsquo;
and is described in the <i>Glossary</i> of Cormac of
Cashel, composed towards the close of the ninth
century, as quadrangular in shape, and having
straight spots of black and white. Some of these
were inlaid with gold and silver and adorned
with gems. No entire set of the ancient men is
now known to exist, though frequent mention is
made of the brigade or family of chessmen in
many old manuscripts. Kings of bone, seated in
sculptured chairs, about 2 inches in height, have
been found, and specimens of them engraved in
recent antiquarian publications&rdquo; (D&rsquo;Arcy Magee&rsquo;s
<i>History of Ireland</i>).</p>

<p>The most striking part of the Gap is where
the valley contracts so as to bring the precipitous
sides very close together. The peasants have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
named this the Pike, and to the grotesquely
formed rocks along the pass they have also given
names&mdash;the Turnpike, O&rsquo;Donoghue&rsquo;s Heart, and
so on. The impression conveyed as you proceed,
is of gloom and of a certain aloofness from the
ordinary. The eagle soaring above is no uncommon
sight.</p>

<p>A little distance from the Pike is a lonely tarn
called the Black Lake (Loch Dubh), where St.
Patrick imprisoned the last Irish snake, which is
supposed to live in its depths. A little south of
the Pass the spot is pointed out where the last
Irish wolf was slain.</p>

<p>There is a stamp of wild force in all that
meets the eye while traversing the Gap, which
is not diminished as at Gap Cottage the end is
neared. At its commencement cars have had to
be abandoned. You must ride or walk. If you
have elected to walk you will probably now be
footsore and weary. Even the sure-footed ponies
generally used may not prevent fatigue from the
rough, precipitous road, but it is forgotten when,
on leaving the Gap, a turn in the path brings in
view one of the most famous glens of Killarney&mdash;the
Black Valley. This was formerly described
as so black, so desolate, that it might have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
named the Valley of the Shadow of Death. It
owes this reputation merely to its English name&mdash;a
mistranslation from the Irish one&mdash;Cumin
Dubh (O&rsquo;Duff&rsquo;s Valley). No one knows who
this O&rsquo;Duff was, however, and the Black Valley
is a more romantic name for a singularly wild
and beautiful scene.</p>

<p>The path now inclines to the left, bringing in
view the Upper Lake, its waters glowing like
burnished gold, if, as often happens, it approaches
the sunset hour when you reach it. How lovely
it looks, guarded on every side by those great
mountains which hold so many secrets!</p>

<p>Not without a passing regret do we leave the
Gap. It has its own charm, arousing wonder
and curiosity and a certain awe. One really feels
when the Pike is reached as though there was
nothing strange in its having emanated from the
giant&rsquo;s sword.</p>

<p>The scene surveyed from here is very beautiful,
and tempts delay, but the Upper Lake must be
reached. By the side of the hill you descend is
the Logan stone, or &ldquo;balanced rock,&rdquo; long considered
a wonder of Druidical times. Some affirm
now that its rocking motion is from natural
causes, but, set as it is on the lonely hill, it looks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
as if it well might have been fashioned by those
stern old heathen.</p>

<p>Still descending, the road takes a sharp backward
curve to the foot of Fubrahy&rsquo;s Crags; then,
turning again, it continues till, after crossing a
bridge, it passes through an opening in the wall
into Gurmaheen Demesne, within which are
tea and waiting rooms, called &ldquo;Lord Brandon&rsquo;s
Cottage.&rdquo; From thence a short path descends
to the Upper Lake, where in some sheltered bay
your boat awaits you.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE LAKES AND THE MOUNTAINS</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">No</span> one has ever realized the enchantment of
Killarney or fallen under its spell who has not
been upon its waters. As the boat glides into
the Upper Lake, all that has ever been said of
its varied beauty seems poor compared to the
reality. The mountains which surround it on
every side give indescribable grandeur to its
scenery&mdash;so much so that, added to the contrasted
beauty of its wooded isles, it is on the
whole conceded that it bears the golden apple
from its sister lakes; certainly, as the boatmen
row from point to point, you say so, and
memory, bringing back the vision in after days&mdash;perhaps
in the hot and dusty thoroughfare&mdash;confirms
the verdict.</p>

<p>The Upper Lake contains twelve small islands,
some of them of such a height that at a distance
they resemble so many lofty towers standing in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
the waters, their summits crowned with bright
green wreaths of the arbutus and many another
verdant shrub and tree. In other aspects they
appear to represent the ruins of stately palaces.
To add to this effect, their edges are so much
worn by the dashing of water against them, and
by rains washing away the earth, and &ldquo;time
hath so disjointed these marble rocks,&rdquo; that
some hang in such curious fashion as to represent
a rude architectural formation.</p>

<p>The extraordinary verdure, not only of the
isles, but of the mountains, is even more striking
viewed from these lonely waters than where man
has left more perceptible trace of his presence.
It seems incredible that giant fern, tree-shrubs,
and plants should flourish in tropical profusion
at the great heights to which they attain, and
without the artificial aid which is impossible.</p>

<p>This wonderful foliage is the glory of all the
islands, but here it throws into intense relief the
sublimity inseparable from great mountain
scenery, and even in point of height the MacGillicuddy&rsquo;s
Reeks can claim greatness. More than
a hundred years ago Holmes, in his <i>Tour in
Ireland</i>, records his first glimpse of the noble
range: &ldquo;Their peaks immersed in mist and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
storms, along their prodigious furrows the
cataracts, swollen by recent rains, tumbling with
fury and glistening like liquid silver; in a little
time the peaks piercing through the clouds, the
grey mists slow descending like a great curtain,
through which the sun darted his rays.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="mangerton" id="mangerton"></a>
<img src="images/bik06.jpg" width="600" height="350"
alt="" />
<p class="caption">AT THE FOOT OF MANGERTON MOUNTAIN, KILLARNEY.</p>
</div>

<p>The Purple Mountain, always beautiful and
changeful in aspect as the lakes themselves, looks
down from the north, while on the other side
rises Torc&rsquo;s noble outline, and further off great
Mangerton.</p>

<p>Many of the mountains are densely wooded to
a great height&mdash;giant ferns, the rowan, holly,
yew, juniper. Above all the arbutus grow in a
tangle of profusion, and on rocks where no earth
appears. How the steep rocks and crags can
give root-hold to this forestry of green is a marvel
to the beholder, the roots being simply filaments
entwining themselves round crevices in the stone,
holding on with a grim tenacity which defies the
wildest storm&mdash;better even than the forest tree.
The birds of the air have dropped their seeds, or
the winds carried them to this their home, and
they will not let it go. Here will they stay as
long, perchance, as the rocks themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expected the loveliness I met,&rdquo; said an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
English visitor to Killarney lately, &ldquo;and I believe
the strongest impression made on me was by
those beautiful tropical shrubs in mid-air, as they
seemed, and with no apparent hold on the
soil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The arbutus is supposed by some to have
come from Spain and to have been cultivated in
the first instance by the early monks; but the
more general belief is that it was indigenous.
It is not to be found of spontaneous growth
nearer to Ireland than the very south of France
and Italy, and only as a shrub, while about the
lakes and mountains here it often becomes a large
and tall tree. Pliny mentions it as extraordinary
that it should thus grow in Arabia, and Petra
Bellonus also observes this as occurring on Mount
Athos in Macedonia. But it seems to love its
Irish home best, and to revel in the luxuriant
growth which makes it so noticeable in Killarney&rsquo;s
leafy forests.</p>

<p>The blossoms of the arbutus grow in clusters
of white bells, not unlike those of the lily of the
valley, in great abundance, and nestling under
bunches of bright green leaves. It has, at the
same time, ripe and green fruit on its branches,
first a deep pale yellow, deepening, as it advances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
to ripeness, then a brilliant scarlet like that of a
strawberry. Autumn and winter are the seasons
of its greatest bloom and beauty.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p class="caption">O&rsquo;SULLIVAN&rsquo;S PUNCHBOWL, KILLARNEY.</p>
</div>

<p>A most beautiful cascade at the western end of
the lake tumbles down the mountain side and
empties itself in a dazzling sheet of foam into its
waters. The music of its fall seems very close as
the boat passes the various isles, and you are told
the legends connected with them. One in particular,
MacCarthy&rsquo;s Island, is pointed out as the
last refuge of one of the great family. We will
find other memories of this powerful sept in
many a local tradition. Here a battle was
fought, a fort taken or lost, triumph or defeat,
and then you are pointed to a grave&mdash;the end of
it all!</p>

<p>But on the Upper Lake it is hard to think of
anything but the lovely, lonely scenery&mdash;lonelier
because of the everlasting hills which compass it
around.</p>

<p>Eagle Island was once the haunt of these royal
birds, and still the golden eagle has not forsaken
it, though less seldom seen. Ronayne Island is
named after one who lived there, apart from his
fellow-men, in self-chosen solitude. At each
point there is something to relate, while every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
turn produces a change in outline or colour so as
almost to form a fresh scene. Many a lovely
little bay and channel are explored, till too soon
the boat passes the last islet, enters the last bay,
rounds the last promontory.</p>

<p>A very narrow part of the passage occurs here
where this promontory juts out, leaving a breadth
of only about thirty feet. It is called Coleman&rsquo;s
Eye. Some legendary person is said to have
leaped across the stream here, leaving his footprints
on the rock beyond.</p>

<p>And now, with long look and reluctant farewell,
we are on the Long Range, the river connecting
the Upper with its sister lakes.</p>

<p>In Holmes&rsquo; <i>Tour</i> he thus characterizes the
Long Range: &ldquo;I should distinguish the Upper
Lake as being the most sublime, the Lower the
most beautiful, and Muckross Lake the most
picturesque, the winding passage leading to the
Upper containing a surprising combination of the
three, probably not to be exceeded by any spot in
the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Long Range is about two miles in length.
Its margins are gemmed with water-lilies, snowy
and golden. Here the <i>Osmunda regalia</i> is seen
growing almost in forests, and of great size, its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
branches, as well as those of the alder, birch,
yew, arbutus, and many another, entwining as if
they grew from a common root. Other rare
ferns, some peculiar to Kerry, as the Brutle fern
(<i>Trichomanes speciosum</i>), completely clothe the
wild crags on either side. But it is hopeless to
attempt specifying the variety of foliage, the
different shades of green, the masses of heather
and gorse, which in all stages of their bloom,
their first spring glory, or the no less lovely
golden and brown tints of autumn, make the
most rugged mountain sides beautiful. And let
not the little &ldquo;bog down&rdquo; be forgotten which
around Killarney makes the bogs resemble waving
fields of snow. &ldquo;Light of love&rdquo; the peasant girls
call this bog rush, for a breath sends its down
floating lightly away. A little white tuft of
silky cotton, from its shortness of no practical
use in the work-a-day world, so it lives its life
unharmed, gay as the bog-land dwellers themselves.</p>

<p>Very wild and grand is the scenery here.
Rocks in a hundred forms appear as the banks
are passed, and behind, at nearer or further distance,
rise the greater mountain heights.</p>

<p>The boat passes several islets, named from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
resemblance, real or imaginary, The Jolly Boat,
The Cannon Rock, The Man-of-War Rock&mdash;a
mass like a vessel, keel uppermost. Soon the
far-famed Eagle&rsquo;s Nest is reached, a rugged, precipitous
cliff 1,700 feet high. Here the eagles
still have their nest, for Nature has secured them
from the hand of man. It is a very majestic
rock, thickly clothed with evergreens nearly to
the summit, where, however, heath and a few
scattered shrubs hide the nest, and show the
great outline, the rugged mass, in stern sublimity.
Here the Killarney Echo is best heard.</p>

<p>Perhaps among the many writers who have
tried to describe the effect produced by this echo,
Mrs. Hall gives the most vivid impression.
She says: &ldquo;The bugler first played a single
note; it was caught up and repeated loudly;
softly, again loudly; again softly, and then as if
by a hundred instruments rolling around and
above the mountains, and dying softly away.
Then a few notes were blown, a multitude of
voices replied, sometimes pausing, then mingling
in a strain of sublime grandeur and delicate
sweetness. Then came the firing of a cannon,
when every mountain around seemed instinct with
angry life, and replied in voices of thunder, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
sound being multiplied a thousandfold, first a
terrific growl, then a fearful crash, both caught
up and returned by the surrounding hills, while
those nearest became silent, awaiting the oncoming
of those that were distant, then dropping to
a gentle lull, as if the winds only created them,
then breaking forth again into a combined and
terrific roar.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">MUCKROSS LAKE AND GLENA MOUNTAIN FROM TORC COTTAGE&mdash;EARLY MORNING.</p>
</div>

<p>Soon after passing Eagle&rsquo;s Nest the end of the
Long Range is reached, and the stream divides,
skirting round Dinish Island into Lough Leane
on the left side, to the right passing under Old
Weir Bridge into Muckross Lake.</p>

<p>The Old Weir Bridge consists of two arches;
only one affords a passage for boats, and as the
water of the Upper Lake rushes into Muckross
Lake on its way to the sea through the Laune,
the current is extremely rapid, and it is quite
usual for tourists to disembark and walk, meeting
the boat on the other side. Those with strong
nerves, however, enjoy &ldquo;shooting the rapids.&rdquo;
You then find yourself in Torc (or Muckross)
Lake, and opposite Dinish Island, on which is a
pretty cottage, where it is usual to halt for rest
and refreshment. The chief feature of the latter
is salmon, broiled in cutlets on a fire made of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
arbutus, the slices skewered on a spray of the
same, which is said to impart a delicious flavour
to the fish.</p>

<p>There are so many objects of interest clustered
around the Lakes that it is vain trying to compress
them into the description of a day&rsquo;s excursion.
When time is an object, the tourist can
manage to &ldquo;do&rdquo; the whole three lakes, but if
time permits, the point we have now reached
should be the limit of his first day, and a row
home over the lovely waters of Lough Leane to
Ross Island is a fitting close to it. The grand
old Castle never looks so picturesque as in the
evening glow; let it be his last memory of the
day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smlfont">MUCKROSS</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> more beautiful than the scene viewed
from Muckross (&ldquo;the place of wild swine&rdquo;) can
be imagined. Its woods and lawns form a large
promontory, shooting far into the lake, which
the wooded isles beyond seem almost to join,
the water breaking and glancing between like
tiny bays. Muckross Abbey Mansion stands in
lovely grounds, which, fringing the slope to the
water&rsquo;s edge, form a beautiful shore to the
lake.</p>

<p>The scene which this point commands is
unrivalled&mdash;indeed, Torc lake (Torc, a wild
boar) need fear no comparison. Toomies and
Glena are opposite, so softly outlined by the
beautiful waving forests which cling to their
sides that their magnificent height is half forgotten.
In contrast the hills which rise above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
the Eagle&rsquo;s Nest are bare, broken, almost
savage.</p>

<p>But if it is hard to convey by words an idea of
scenery in general, more difficult is it with that
of Killarney, so varied are the effects produced
under its changeful skies,</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Shining through sorrow&rsquo;s beam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saddening through sorrow&rsquo;s gleam.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Young, our English visitor of long ago,
notices this much. In one place he observes:
&ldquo;Torc was obscured by the sun shining immediately
above him, and, casting a stream of
burning light on the water, displayed an effect
to describe which the pencil of a Claude alone
would be equal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ruined Abbey of Muckross stands in the
grounds of Muckross demesne, and was founded
by a MacCarthy Mor in 1340, according to the
<i>Annals of the Four Masters</i>, upon the site of a
much older church, which was destroyed by fire.
It was built for Conventual Franciscans, and was
dedicated to the Holy Trinity. The original
name was Irrelagh.</p>

<p>The two principal parts of the ruin are the
convent and the church, the latter about 100
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
feet in length and 24 feet in breadth, the steeple
standing between the nave and chancel, resting
on four high and slender pointed arches.</p>

<p>The cloisters are in a very perfect state, consisting
of a beautiful quadrangle of marble arches,
some pointed, some with semicircular heads,
enclosing a square, in the centre of which stands
the great yew-tree, said to be as old as the Abbey
itself. It rises to the height of 60 feet, its
spreading branches overshadowing the cloisters
and forming a canopy, impervious to the sun.
The circumference of its trunk is 13 feet, and it
is regarded with much awe because of a belief
that anyone attempting to pluck a leaf or branch,
or in any way injure this yew, will not be alive
on that day twelve months.</p>

<p>The principal entrance is by a handsome
Pointed doorway, from which is seen the great
eastern window, with its simple, beautiful tracery.
The space within is filled with tombs, many of
them nameless. A large modern one in the
centre of the choir covers a vault, where in
ancient times were interred the MacCarthys,
and, more lately, the O&rsquo;Donoghues.</p>

<p>Close to this tomb is the slab which formerly
covered the vault, without inscription, but bearing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
the arms of the Earl of Clancarty of the
old creation, this title and that of Viscount
Valentia being bestowed by Queen Elizabeth in
1565 on Donald MacCarthy Mor, the head of
the elder branch of that great family. His
haughty followers would none of it, and slighted
the chieftain who had condescended, however
grudgingly, to accept an honour at the hands of
the Sassenach.</p>

<p>The dormitories, cellars, kitchens, refectories,
etc., are in good preservation, but the upper
rooms are unroofed. There is a great fireplace
in the refectory, where once the monks kept good
cheer. Very silent and deserted it is now, with
the innumerable graves around.</p>

<p>The great Torc Cascade empties itself into
Muckross Lake a little more than a mile from
the Abbey. It comes from the Devil&rsquo;s Punch
Bowl, which it is worth ascending Mangerton to
see. On the western side of the mountain is a
small circular lake, about 600 yards in diameter
across the top. From the brink, as you look
downwards, there is a depth of nearly 300 yards.
This is the Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl. On the side
next Muckross there is an immense perpendicular
chasm, equal in depth to the height of the sides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
of the Bowl, into which its overflowings rush
and are conveyed through a narrow channel,
called the Devil&rsquo;s Stream, to the shore of Muckross
Lake, tumbling down the sides of the hill,
nearly 200 feet, in a great cascade.</p>

<p>In the peninsula of Muckross is a mine, now
disused, which, when worked by an English
company in 1804, gave a large output of the
finest copper ore.</p>

<p>There are many indications of mineral treasures
yet to be discovered among the hills and glens of
Killarney. When Dr. Berkeley was asked his
opinion of Muckross at a time when Art was
considered far superior to Nature, he replied:
&ldquo;The French monarch might possibly be able
to create another Versailles, but could not, with
all his revenues, lay out another Muckross.&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smlfont">ROSS, INNISFALLEN, AND THE LOWER LAKE</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Ross</span> is only separated from the mainland by a
narrow cut through a morass, which gives it
its claim to be an island.</p>

<p>This division is probably artificial, and made
in former days to strengthen the fortifications of
the Castle. A carriage road from the town of
Killarney crosses the small connecting bridge
and brings the tourist under the walls of Ross
Castle, where there is a landing-place for those
who come by water.</p>

<p>Ross Castle is still a splendid old fortress, far
less injured by time or mischance than most of
its contemporaries in Kerry. A tall and stately
building, it is seen from far, dominating Lough
Leane and adding additional charm to the view,
with its massive buttresses and battlements,
reminders of the old fighting days. It is but a
short distance between Ross and Muckross, yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
the character of the scene is utterly changed.
Say what we will of the other lakes, Lough
Leane remains the lake of enchantment.</p>

<p>Ross is a very ancient Castle, built by some far-back
O&rsquo;Donoghue, the precise date unknown.
Within is a spiral staircase of stone mounting to
the top, from whence a marvellous panorama lies
before you.</p>

<p>In 1652 Ross Castle was held by Lord Muskerry
for the King, during the Parliamentary
wars, against General Ludlow. It was well
garrisoned and provisioned, and the defenders
were prepared vigorously to repel the foe, yet
they surrendered almost at once. There was an
old prophecy that Ross Castle would never be
taken till warships were seen on the lake, and
when the garrison beheld the boats which
General Ludlow had built and conveyed overland
approaching to attack, they yielded. The
prophecy was fulfilled: it was useless to fight
against fate. But it is more to legendary than
historical lore that Ross Castle owes the fascination
which surrounds it.</p>

<p>The guides of Killarney deserve mention here,
for they add to the enjoyment of the various
excursions, knowing every legend, each association,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
the origin of every name, and are even
capable of inventing on the spur of the moment
romances the most picturesque, wonders the most
thrilling, discerning at a glance on whom to
expend their powers of imagination. &ldquo;All sorts
and conditions of men&rdquo; come under their ken.
In the tourist season scarce a land but has its
representative, to some of whom Ireland was a
sealed page till they listened to the tales of
Killarney from her guides.</p>

<p>Here they point to you the very window from
which the great O&rsquo;Donoghue leaped into the
lake below. There he reigns in the regions of
enchantment, greater and happier than in his
earthly sovereignty. Once in every seven years
on a May morning, before the first beams of the
sun have arisen over the mountain tops, the
sweetest strains of fairy music are heard, and the
great chieftain may be seen on a splendid snow-white
charger, shod with silver shoes, riding over
the lake, preceded by a joyous band of youths
and maidens scattering flowers before him. Well
it is for the mortal who sees him; prosperity
will follow from that day forth.</p>

<p>Just, generous, and greatly beloved were the
O&rsquo;Donoghues of Ross, and their memory is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
perpetuated among a people who do not easily
forget. Wander where you will, you find some
association with the name, particularly among
rock and crag on the Lower Lake, of which
O&rsquo;Donoghue&rsquo;s Horse is the most remarkable.
This rock has been fretted and worn away by
the action of the waters into a curious semblance
of a horse in the act of drinking. Then there is
O&rsquo;Donoghue&rsquo;s prison, his table, his pulpit&mdash;each
with its story.</p>

<p>You will be told, too, how at the deepest part
of this lake, more than 60 fathoms down, at a
spot between Ross and Innisfallen, a great carbuncle
may be seen, which on a dark night lights
up the rocks at the bottom of the lake, and
shows the palaces and towers of the ancient city
which the waters now cover.</p>

<p>Ross is the largest island on the lake. It
contains about 80 acres. On the southern point
is a famous copper mine, opened in 1804 by
Colonel Hall, who found clear proof that it had
been worked at a very remote period. Rude
stone hammers of very ancient make were discovered&mdash;Danes&rsquo;
hammers, the people call them&mdash;and
the traces of fire were found. The vein,
however, gave out after four years, during which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
time, says Crofton Croker, &ldquo;nearly &pound;60,000
worth of ore was disposed of at Swansea, some
cargoes producing &pound;40 per ton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The country round the lakes is very rich in ores
of various kinds. Lead ore has been discovered,
and the mountains abound with iron. Specimens
of ore which contain tin are also found.</p>

<p>Killarney has treasures, however, which better
suit the witchery of her beauty. Pearls are
found in Lough Leane, and still more often in
the River Laune, which runs out of it. These
are, of course, very inferior to the Oriental jewel,
but now and again a fine specimen is obtained.
&ldquo;A little Kerry pearle&rdquo; was not considered an
unworthy present to a great man in 1756; also
&ldquo;a dozen Kerry stones,&rdquo; these probably being
the beautiful amethysts found in the cliffs near
Kerry Head. These have always been valued.
A set of ear-rings, a necklace, and other ornaments
composed of these amethysts were presented
to Queen Caroline (wife of George II.)
by the Countess of Kerry, and most graciously
received. A like gracious reception was given
to an Irish pearl presented by the Bishop of
Limerick to the great Anselm, Archbishop of
Canterbury in 1074.</p>

<p class="caption">THE ISLAND OF INNISFALLEN.<br />
In the lower lake of Killarney. It once possessed a monastery where the &ldquo;Annals of Innisfallen,&rdquo; now at the Bodleian, were written.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
Very brilliant are the &ldquo;Kerry diamonds,&rdquo; and
very pretty, but valueless save to the children
who pick them up, and perhaps to that fairy
world whose standards are not the sordid ones of
mortals. To them these lovely crystals, whether
clear or coloured, may be the true treasure.</p>

<p>Beautiful Innisfallen, with hill and glen, creek
and harbour, and cliffs overhung by trees shading
the many bays. The Gem of Killarney it is
called. &ldquo;Not heaven&rsquo;s reflex, but a bit fallen out
of heaven itself,&rdquo; were Macaulay&rsquo;s words, and
they express the feeling called forth by its rich
verdure, its wonders of foliage and of colour, the
ineffable beauty which clothes it as a mantle. Yet
so great are its contrasts that in this island of 24
acres are woods as gloomy as the ancient Druidical
forests, thick with giant ash and enormous hollies.</p>

<p>As you approach the island you seem to draw
near such a forest, so close are these great trees,
extending into the water. On landing, you find
they encircle a lawn of the deepest and most vivid
green. Open glades through the trees give
enchanting vistas&mdash;the lofty peaks of Toomies
and Glena, the misty summits of the Purple
Mountain, Ross Castle and its wooded shores,
sunny islands and sparkling waters, sometimes so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
still as to reflect the woods and mountains as in a
mirror. In the morning hour the mountains
bordering on the Lower Lake are left in shadow,
but as the day goes on the sun glides imperceptibly
along the line of the great chain, and
darts his rays on that side of the mountains
which lies next to the lake. All their bold
irregularities are then revealed&mdash;their protruding
rocks, their deep glens, and the lake is illuminated
amid its dark and wooded isles by the long
gleams which pass athwart its waves.</p>

<p>At such hours it looks too fair a world for sin
and sorrow, but yonder stands the Castle, with
ruined battlements and many a grim sign of the
stormy past, while fair Innisfallen itself contains
a ruin where once holy men maintained a warfare
equally deadly against the powers of evil, though
fought with no mortal weapons.</p>

<p>Little remains of the Abbey of Innisfallen,
founded in the sixth century by St. Finian.
Even the walls are levelled save for the remains
of an oratory, whose western gable contains a
doorway with rich decorations. This monastery,
however decayed, will always be famous, because
the <i>Annals of Innisfallen</i> were written here.</p>

<p>The original work is in the Bodleian Library.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
It is on parchment and in medium quarto, and
contains fifty-seven leaves. Extracts from the
Old Testament and a history of the ancient world
down to the arrival of St. Patrick in Ireland in
432 form the earlier part. From this period it
deals exclusively with the affairs of Ireland,
terminating with 1319. It seems to have been
the production of two monks, one carrying it to
1216, the other continuing it to 1320. It is one
of the earliest of Irish histories, and considered by
savants as taking high rank among them.</p>

<p>In 1100 the Abbey was plundered by Mildwin
O&rsquo;Donoghue of a great treasure of gold, silver,
and rich goods of the adjacent country, which had
been deposited there as secure sanctuary. Many
of the clergy were slain by the MacCarthys,
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; writes the monk, &ldquo;God soon punished this
act of sacrilege and impiety by bringing many of
its authors to an untimely end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, there is peace now in fair Innisfallen.
The visitor bears away its impress with the
memory of one of the fairest spots on earth.</p>

Glena, the &ldquo;glen of good fortune,&rdquo; is one of
the most eagerly sought out beauty spots of
Killarney. Glena Bay is the first part of the
Lower Lake if it is entered from the Long
Range, but by whatever way you reach it the
picture which meets the eye is unsurpassed.</p>

<p>The mountains of Glena and Toomies are
densely wooded to their base, the trees hanging
over their sides and coming down in rich luxuriance
to the water&rsquo;s edge. A very forest of the
finest arbutus, with berry and blossom together in
autumn, with oak, ash, pine, birch and alder,
white thorn, yew, and holly, it must be seen to
realize the colour effect or the matchless tintings
of gorse and heather, a great mosaic quivering in
the sunshine. The varieties of this immense
scenery of forest are impossible to describe, the
woods extending about six miles in length, and
from half a mile to a mile and a half in breadth,
while the inequalities of the ground produce
wondrous effects of light and shadow.</p>

<p>Glena is all soft loveliness, but rugged rock
and crag, and the stern grandeur of Torc Mountain
on the other side, strike again that minor
chord never far from Killarney&rsquo;s brightest
scenes.</p>

Lough Leane has upwards of thirty isles, large
and small, and as the boat is rowed past Glena
shore you see them in all their varied form and
colour, from Ross to tiny Mouse Island. It is a
fair sight. There is a little bay at the foot of
the Toomies where you can land to reach
O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s Cascade, one of the greatest of the
Killarney waterfalls, not only from its size, but
from the peculiar formation of the bed down
which it dashes. It really consists of three falls.
&ldquo;The uppermost, passing over a bridge of rocks,
falls about 20 feet perpendicularly into a natural
basin; then, bursting between two hanging rocks,
the torrent hastens down a second precipice into
a second receptacle, from which it rolls over into
the lowest chamber of the fall. It is about
70 feet high. The roar of the descending water
can be heard from afar, and is almost deafening
when near. Beneath a projecting rock overhanging
the lowest basin is a grotto, with a
seat rudely cut in the rock. From this little
grotto the view of the cascade is peculiarly
beautiful. It appears a continued flight of three
foamy stories. The recess is overshadowed by
an arch of foliage so thick as to interrupt the
admission of light.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
The forest about Toomies is still the haunt of
the old red deer of Ireland, and a grand stag hunt
is occasionally organized, the cries of the hounds,
the shouting of the hunters, the firing of the
signalling cannon, combining to awake the
mountain echoes for many miles around. It is a
cruel sport, though the stag is now, as a rule,
saved from death. Yet its gallant attempts to
save itself, its struggles to get free from the
cordon of enemies around, its agonies of terror as,
bounding for refuge to the heights, it is confronted
by shouting men, and turned to confront
the savage pack, are cruel enough. It leaps from
rock to rock and chasm to chasm with sobbing
breath and big tears, and plunges into the lake
in desperation, to be met by the boats watching
for it. Of late years it is set free, but it is not
sentimentality to imagine that the grim experience
it has passed through will render the life given to
it a thing of terror, haunted by the bay of the
hounds and the shouts of the hunters.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE KILLARNEY FOLK</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> people who dwell on the shores of these
lovely lakes are a handsome race, tall and finely
formed, with clear-cut features and dark and
most expressive eyes, often of the Irish grey or
deep violet, with long black lashes. Pencilled
eyebrows and abundance of dark-brown hair
usually accompany these, and that clear complexion
which the moist western breezes confer.
They love music and dancing, the &ldquo;boys and
girls,&rdquo; who, meeting on a roadside, only require
a merry tune to &ldquo;foot it away&rdquo; and forget their
cares.</p>

<p>But with all their lightheartedness their
standard of duty is very high, and family ties are
sacred. Seldom, if ever, is infidelity known
among the married, and a certain honour is given
to the head of the poorest household. Husband
and wife each has a distinct place, which neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
would dream of usurping, the husband having
the chief, of course. In one case, however, and
that a very important one to an Irishman, right
of precedence is universally granted to the wife.
This is when it happens that she is by birth of a
superior tribe to her husband. &ldquo;I am a MacCarthy;
my husband is only a so-and-so,&rdquo; she will say
proudly.</p>

<p>There are many &ldquo;shealings&rdquo; around and on
the sides of the mountains, where the &ldquo;mountainy
men,&rdquo; as they are called, cultivate patches
of land with a success due to their patient
industry. They have hens, a few goats, and
perhaps some lean mountain sheep, and all these
are liable to visitations from the eagles when
rearing their young. Often, too, they have one
or two cows of the Kerry breed, which find
sweet pickings among the rocks, and give more
milk on the scant herbage than the sleek and
well-favoured kine of richer counties. This
breed is small, with long horns and wild, handsome
heads.</p>

<p>Simple-hearted, generous and faithful are
these men and women, with a dignified courtesy
of manner which tells of the Eastern strain in
their blood. Their courtesy and good manners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
are, indeed, very charming. For instance, you
may have been out all day with a man, and
when you reach his home he will step in first,
and, turning, offer you his hand and bid you
welcome, as though it were the first time he had
met you that day. He welcomes you, and then
you will be placed in the seat of honour, and
refreshments brought you, the refusal of which
would be an insult.</p>

<p>The love of classical learning among the
peasantry was great. It continues still, though
the classics are not cultivated in this practical age
as in the days when they were taught by travelling
scholars at the hedge schools. All the old
writers on Killarney mention their wonder at
meeting poorly-clad men and boys able to
converse fluently in Latin, and studying the best
Latin, and even Greek, authors. The power of
reading Homer in the original was greatly
coveted, and often attained. The magic of their
surroundings may have had much to do with
kindling the peasant&rsquo;s imagination to passionate
interest in a dead language.</p>

<p>The first distinct mention of the sea-coast
adjoining Killarney occurs in the works of
Ptolemy, who wrote in the second century. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
speaks of the river of Kenmare under the title
of Iernus, while again it is called Fluctus Desmonda,
or the River of Desmond. At this
Iernus of Ptolemy is placed by ancient authors
the landing of several Milesian colonists, and
though Irish history before the Christian era is
chiefly traditional, there seems some foundation
for this.</p>

<p>If we believe the bards and seers, the Milesian
immigration was the fifth which came to colonize
Hibernia out of the overflowing tribes of Asia.
Of the fourth, the Tuatha de Danans, they tell
a curious tale. These colonizers are depicted as
accomplished sooth-sayers and necromancers who
came out of Greece. They could quell storms,
cure diseases, work in metals, foretell future events,
and, by their supernatural powers as well as by
virtue of the Lia Fail, or Stone of Destiny, they
subdued the Firbolgs, who had preceded them,
and exercised sovereignty, till they in turn were
displaced by the Gaelic or fifth immigration.</p>

<p>Sometimes these called themselves Gael, from
an ancestor; sometimes Milesians, from Milesius,
projector of the immigration; sometimes Scota,
from his wife. They came from Spain, and all
their magical arts did not save the Tuatha from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
defeat. &ldquo;In vain they surrounded themselves
and their coveted island with magic-made
tempest and terrors; in vain they reduced it in
size so as to be almost invisible from sea.
Amergin, one of the sons of Milesius, was a
Druid skilled in all the arts of the East, and, led
by him, his brothers countermined the magicians
and beat them with their own weapons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among the mountains of South Kerry the
peasants point out a stone where Queen Scota,
daughter of Pharaoh of Egypt, and wife of
Milesius of Spain, is believed to lie buried. She
was killed in battle three days after landing with
her sons on this coast. Upon the flat of the
stone is an Ogham inscription, which reads,
&ldquo;Leacht Scoihin&rdquo; (&ldquo;The grave mound of
Scota&rdquo;). Ogham experts think this inscription
a forgery, but the old tradition makes it at least
probable that within sound of the thunder of the
Atlantic, far from her own people, lies the
daughter of the Pharaohs.</p>

<p>From an antiquarian point of view Kerry is
one of the most interesting places in the British
Isles, and very rich in relics of the past. An
arch&aelig;ological society has been formed, which is
endeavouring to rescue the relics and monuments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
from neglect and decay. Killarney has been
found a singularly promising field to explore,
though much has perished.</p>

<p>The Celtic nature is curiously complex, and
those who do not themselves possess it find it hard
to understand. It has one quality in which no
other race has ever equalled it, and that is a
marvellous power of absorbing alien nationalities
to itself, so that, while conquered, it yet conquers.
It is a matter of current knowledge that the
English became more Irish than the Irish themselves.
They intermarried with the families of
native chiefs, gave their children to be nursed by
Irish foster-mothers, spoke the Irish tongue,
espoused the Irish interests. Had this power of
amalgamation been encouraged, and not sternly
repressed by the English Government, there was
a period when it might have changed completely
the destiny of Ireland; but it was not to be.</p>

<p>There is an interesting poem by an Irishman,
&ldquo;The Geraldines,&rdquo; from which I quote one
verse:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;These Geraldines! these Geraldines! not long our air they breathed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not long they fed on venison in Irish water seethed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not often had their children been by Irish mothers nursed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When from their full and genial hearts an Irish feeling burst.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The English monarchs strove in vain, by law, and force, and bribe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To win from Irish thoughts and ways this more than Irish tribe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For still they cling to fosterage, to <i>breitheamh</i>, cloak, and bard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What King dare say to Geraldine, &lsquo;Your Irish wife discard&rsquo;?&rdquo;<br /></span>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE FAIRIES&mdash;AND FAREWELL!</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Raths, or &ldquo;fairy forts,&rdquo; of Killarney have
hitherto seldom been explored. They are circular
grassy mounds enclosing a field, generally
small. Underneath are found stone chambers,
their beehive roofs and walls made of unmortared
stone. It is supposed that here the ancient Celts
fortified themselves and their cattle, retreating in
winter into the stone chambers. Be this as it
may, for centuries the Irish have believed them
to be tenanted by a fairy race, whose palaces are
here, and who guard hidden treasure.</p>

<p>These are the Sidhe, or people of the hill, the
noblest among these mysterious folk. Some say
they are the spirits of the Tuatha de Danan,
that strange race which occupied Ireland till the
Milesians came, when, conquered by a greater
magic than their own, they disappeared. Strange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
to say, no mortal descendant of these people has
ever been traced in any Irish family.</p>

<p class="caption">CUTTING PEAT FROM THE BOG.<br />
It takes less than a week for a man to cut his fuel supply for a whole year.</p>
</div>

<p>But there is another race, and these are the
fairies proper, very human in their traits, tricky
and malicious if slighted or offended, but good
friends if treated properly. I cannot resist quoting
a story (&ldquo;Hanafin and his Cows&rdquo;) told in a
late Kerry Arch&aelig;ological Magazine by Lady
Gordon&mdash;a tale of the fairies, originally collected
in Kerry by Mr. J. Curtin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hanafin was a farmer owning a large herd
of cows, which were driven up every morning to
be milked in front of his house. For several
days the tub into which the milk was poured
was mysteriously overturned and the milk spilled.
Hanafin&rsquo;s wife was naturally excessively indignant,
but, in spite of every precaution, the milk
continued to be upset. One morning, however,
as Hanafin was walking past a fairy fort, he
heard a child crying inside it, and a woman&rsquo;s
voice saying: &lsquo;Be quiet awhile! Hanafin&rsquo;s cows
are going home; we&rsquo;ll soon have milk in plenty.&rsquo;
Hanafin went home and personally supervised the
milking, and on the usual overturning stopped
his wife from scolding, telling her this time it
was no fault of the girls, who had been pushed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
by one of the cows against the tub. &lsquo;Leave it
to me,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll try and manage the
business.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The following morning, on hearing the child
cry again in the fort, Hanafin, &lsquo;like the brave
man he was,&rsquo; went inside. He saw no one, but
he said, &lsquo;A child is crying for milk. A cow of
mine will calve to-morrow. I&rsquo;ll let no one milk
that cow; you can do what you like with her
milk.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tub was never overturned again, and for
two years Hanafin prospered in every way,
taking good care of the cow, and never letting
her be milked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, however, Hanafin, being soft-hearted,
went security for some of his neighbours
who had got into trouble, with the
result that their creditors came down on him,
and the bailiffs arrived one day to drive off
his cattle. Hanafin repaired to the fort, and
said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to lose all my cattle, but
I&rsquo;ll try and keep the cow I gave you, and
feed her still, so that the child may have the
milk.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three bailiffs came and went down to the
pasture across the field, but when they drove the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
cows up as far as the fairy fort &lsquo;each bailiff was
caught and thrown hither and over by people he
couldn&rsquo;t see. One moment he was at one side
of the ditch, the next at the other. They were
so roughly handled and bruised that they were
hardly alive, and they not seeing who or what
was doing it! The cattle, raising their tails,
bawled and ran off to the pasture.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The following morning ten policemen and
bailiffs went to take Hanafin&rsquo;s cattle, with
exactly the same results, so that the men &lsquo;barely
left the place alive.&rsquo; Never again did police or
bailiff meddle with Hanafin&rsquo;s cattle, and the
creditors never collected their money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These are the familiar fairies who stole
children out of their cradles, young matrons
from their husbands, and girls from their lovers;
who bewitched cows and blighted potatoes, but
who &ldquo;did you many a good turn too.&rdquo; The
peasant will not lightly lose faith in them, nor
will the fairies lightly forsake the land of beauty,
of sunshine, and of shadow. Quickly as events
march and ideas change in this wonderful age,
hurrying we know not where, and though here
and there someone may be found to dare&mdash;or say
he will&mdash;enter a fairy fort or cut down a fairy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
thorn, I think that with the boldest of these
unbelievers it is a case of the man who denied
the power of the priest to turn him into a rat,
but who, saying &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as well to make sure,&rdquo;
took the precaution of shutting up the cat at
night. &ldquo;Taking it all round,&rdquo; writes Lady
Gordon, &ldquo;it would be a drab world if there
were no fairies in it, no supernatural region in
which nothing is too preposterous to occur....
Earth-bound humanity, seeking to escape from
earth cares, still dreams in one form or other of
a land of strange happenings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How much remains still to be said about
Killarney, its varied interests, its shifting,
matchless scenery! The lover of beauty and
romance, the historian, the arch&aelig;ologist, the
antiquary&mdash;it is a field for each. It has begun
to dawn on the mind of many explorers what
great questions hinge on Celtic antiquities, what
light they may shed upon the ancient history of
Europe, while students of the Irish language say
it will yet prove the key to ancient ones which
are puzzling philologists. Killarney is rich in
Ogham inscriptions, in curious old remains and
relics (utilized hitherto by mason and builder).
Such as are not hopelessly lost are gradually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
being unearthed by the ardent seekers of
to-day.</p>

<p>Whatever changes may be in the future,
Killarney must ever remain a land of enchantment.
Perhaps a few recent words of Alfred
Austin may fitly close this attempt to sketch the
principal features of this fair land.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tender grace of wood and water is set
in a framework of hills, now stern, now ineffably
gentle, now dimpling with smiles, now frowning
and rugged with impending storm, now muffled
and mysterious with mist, only to meet you again
with brilliant sunshine. Here the trout leaps,
there the eagle soars, and there beyond the wild
deer dash through the arbutus covert, through
which they have come to the margin of the
lake to drink, and, scared by your footstep or
your oar, are away back to bracken or heather-covered
moorland. But the first, the final, the
deepest and most enduring impression of Killarney
is that of beauty unspeakably tender,
which puts on at times a garb of grandeur and a
look of awe, only to heighten by contrast its soft
loveliness. How the missel thrushes sing, as
well they may! How the streams and runnels
leap and laugh! For the sound of journeying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
water is never out of your ears, the feeling of the
moist, the fresh, the vernal is never out of your
heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No, never! True words are these with
which reluctantly to say farewell to beautiful
Killarney.</p>

<p><b>Transcriber's Note</b></p>

<p>Minor punctuation errors have been fixed.</p>

<p>The following amendments have been made, for consistency:</p>

<div class="amends">
<p>Page <a href="#Page_24">24</a>&mdash;McGillicuddy&rsquo;s amended to MacGillicuddy&rsquo;s&mdash;... even in point of
height the MacGillicuddy&rsquo;s Reeks ...</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_50">50</a>&mdash;McCarthy amended to MacCarthy&mdash;&ldquo;I am a MacCarthy; my husband is
only a so-and-so,&rdquo; ...</p>
</div>

<p>The frontispiece illustration has been moved to follow the title page. Other
illustrations have been moved where necessary so that they are not in the
middle of a paragraph.</p>

<p>The List of Illustrations notes that "The Eagle&rsquo;s Nest, Killarney" appears
"On the cover." This is preserved as printed; however the illustration was
actually located facing page <a href="#Page_22">22</a>, and the transcriber has left it in this
location.</p>

<p>The transcriber has added links to the beginning of the index for ease of
navigation.</p>

<p>Ditto marks in the Index have been replaced with the appropriate words.</p>
